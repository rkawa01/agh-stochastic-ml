    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "- Practical — set up an LLM API (Gemini) and call it programmatically from Python.\n",
    "- Technical — parse, compile and safely execute code emitted by an LLM.\n",
    "- Research-oriented — evaluate LLM-generated meta-heuristics on a standard benchmark and iterate on them with simple evolutionary operators.\n",
    "- Critical thinking — assess algorithmic ideas for correctness, novelty and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Why are we doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools that extend far beyond chatting. They can generate creative text, translate languages, write different kinds of content, and, importantly for us today, write code. We're going to explore how LLMs can be used to design new algorithms, drawing inspiration from how natural evolution works.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and clearly explains the logic. Variable names are meaningful (e.g., `expected_sum`, `actual_sum`).\n",
      "* **Efficiency:** The solution uses the sum of integers formula (n * (n + 1) // 2) to calculate the expected sum, which is more efficient than iterating through the expected range.  This avoids creating extra lists, saving memory and computation time, and makes the solution O(n) due to the `sum()` function.\n",
      "* **Correctness:** The formula for calculating the sum of integers from 1 to n is correctly implemented.\n",
      "* **Edge Cases:**  The code implicitly handles cases where the missing number is 1 or n by calculating the correct `expected_sum`.  This is an improvement.\n",
      "* **`n` Calculation:**  The `n` (expected length) is calculated as `len(numbers) + 1`.  This is crucial for the correct application of the sum formula.\n",
      "* **Integer Division:** Using `//` (floor division) ensures that the `expected_sum` is always an integer, even if `n * (n + 1)` is an odd number.\n",
      "* **Example Usage:**  The code includes example usage with different input lists, including cases where the missing number is at the beginning or end of the sequence.  This demonstrates the code's versatility and helps the user understand how to use it.  The multiple examples also serve as simple test cases.\n",
      "* **Docstring:**  A clear and concise docstring explains what the function does, the arguments it takes, and the value it returns. This is crucial for good code documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the code works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Calculate Expected Sum:**  It determines the expected sum of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the original size of the list (including the missing number).  The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates this sum efficiently.\n",
      "2. **Calculate Actual Sum:** It calculates the sum of the numbers actually present in the input list.\n",
      "3. **Find the Difference:** The missing number is simply the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "This improved version provides a robust, efficient, and well-documented solution to the problem of finding the missing number. It's suitable for use in various scenarios and easy to understand and maintain.\n",

    "As shown in the plot above, the solution quality fluctuated during the first 5–6 epochs, sometimes even worsening. However, after this initial phase, the process began to converge toward better solutions. This behavior is expected, as the model initially explores various possibilities before identifying more effective algorithms. While the process is inherently stochastic and could occasionally produce worse solutions, in our case, it ultimately led to improvement over time. Overall, we can expect this approach to discover solutions that are at least somewhat better than the initial ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "From algorithmic analysis i noticed that it iteratively was adding new features to the solution or coming with different ideas like: \n",
    "- Adaptive mutation scale based on fitness variance.\n",
    "- Rank-based selection for archive guidance.\n",
    "- Enhanced Elitism using tournament selection.\n",
    "- Implemented exponential decay of archive influence.\n",
    "- Increased Population diversity by periodic reinitialization.\n",
    "- Added Simulated Annealing inspired acceptance criterion\n",
    "- Modified crossover for more influence of the best solution\n",
    "- Reduced archive size and increased reinitialization frequency for some benchmarks.\n",
    "Some of those ideas was added at once and some of them was gradually introduced in following iterations."
